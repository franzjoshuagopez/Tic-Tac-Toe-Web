# Tic-Tac-Toe-Web
This is a learning project that I worked on for practicing python, html, css, js.

A lot of game logic code came from chatgpt inputs used as learning material and familiarizing myself in project file strucutre, segregating code to different files, game logic code etc.

NOTE: this is being run on visual studio code with Python virtual environment. I will add a requirements.txt file for the necessary packages needed
